This app uses fetch to consume the APIs from jsonplaceholder.

It's a post card app coded with react and typescript.

I've made this app during my react course, so you can search cards inside it, but how it was a learning project, all the data is from API, so adding cards is not implemented, but you can search for the ones that exist there.
